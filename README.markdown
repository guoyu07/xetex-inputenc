THE XETEX-INPUTENC OVERRIDE PACKAGE
===================================

This package is designed to emulate LaTeX's `inputenc` package.
It's now ready for testing; I hope that it will make it into
TeX Live 2009.

Use it like the `inputenc` package:
    \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

The `utf8` option is default, of course, but if you're using
that then you don't need this package.
